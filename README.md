SubBuddy
========

## Intro ##

SubBuddy is a Youtube subscription watcher. If a user posts a new video, SubBuddy grabs it and downloads it so you don�t have to.

SubBuddy and the people associated with it are not responsible for anything that happens once the binary is launched. The software is still in a pre-alpha like stage, so expect missing features and crashes. SubBuddy is licensed under the GPLv3 and is free software. Each version�s source will be made available immediately after the binary is uploaded in the form of a 7z archive. Of course, an updated version of SubBuddy's source will be available here on Github for those of you daring enough to deal with something even worse than your average unstable branch.
